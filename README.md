ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @nkiu. 
ðŸ‘€ I am a passionate scientist and engineer specializing in bioanalytics and biochemistry. Currently, I am focused on conceptualizing and innovating in vitro diagnostic (IVD) systems. 
I work on fast prototyping of hardware, software, biosensors, and assays to bring these systems to life. 
Feel free to check out my publications! :D
